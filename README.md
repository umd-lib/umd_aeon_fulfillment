# UMD ArchivesSpace Request Fulfillment via Aeon

## Overview

The [Aeon Fulfillment](https://github.com/AtlasSystems/ArchivesSpace-Aeon-Fulfillment-Plugin)
plugin adds a new request button to archival objects that allows researchers to
place Aeon requests for archival objects discovered via the ArchivesSpace Public
User Interface.

This plugin extends and undoes some of the Aeon plugin. Essentially it removes
the ability to request a top_container from an archival object, but instead
directs users to the top_container's record page, where they can then submit
the request. This includes some additional instructions for requests.

This plugin has dependencies on the following GitHub repositories:

* https://github.com/AtlasSystems/ArchivesSpace-Aeon-Fulfillment-Plugin
* https://github.com/umd-lib/umd_aeon_fulfillment
* https://github.com/umd-lib/umd-lib-aspace-theme

**Note:** The "umd-lib-aspace-theme" contains changes to the view layouts for
displaying the messages generated by the umd_aeon_fulfillment plugin. It also
contains University of Maryland branding.

## Installation

1) Clone the following GitHub repositories into the "plugins" directory:

* https://github.com/AtlasSystems/ArchivesSpace-Aeon-Fulfillment-Plugin
  (as "aeon_fulfillment")
* https://github.com/umd-lib/umd_aeon_fulfillment.git
* https://github.com/umd-lib/umd-lib-aspace-theme.git

2) Add the following to a "common/config/config.rb" file (with appropriate
   changes for your site):

```ruby
  AppConfig[:plugins] << 'umd-lib-aspace-theme'
  AppConfig[:public_theme] = 'umd-lib-aspace-theme'

  AppConfig[:plugins] << 'aeon_fulfillment' << 'umd_aeon_fulfillment'
  AppConfig[:aeon_fulfillment] = {
    'test' => {
      requests_permitted_for_containers_only: true,
      aeon_web_url: 'https://aeon.lib.umd.edu/logon/',
      aeon_return_link_label: 'UMD Archives',
      aeon_site_code: 'TEST'
    }
  }
```

In the above the "test"/"TEST" values refer to the repository the plugin should
apply to.
